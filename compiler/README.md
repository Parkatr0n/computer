# computer/compiler

The compiler is a program to convert .asm files to computer readable machine code.

Machine code files aren't binary files, because some machine code files have to be written by hand.

The Makefile for the compiler can be found in the parent directory, and by calling:

```
make compiler
```

Usually, the compiler exists at **computer/bin/compiler**.
